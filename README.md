# Week1

First commit 

These are the commands I would run to make my first commit. I do not have a laptop to do this at the moment 


git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/AmandaAzania/week1
git push -u origin main

- git init initiates git on my local
computer,
- git add README.md is a command
  to add the README file to my git hub
- git commit -m is where I would write a
  message, to say what changes I made
- git remote add origin is used to point
  to which location exactly im pushing
  the work 2
